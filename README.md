# Software-Modularization
In this project, an agent-based hyper-heuristic is implemented for software modularization. Here, agents with same search perspectives are placed in a coalition. In each step of the search, the most appropriate coalition is automatically selected using reinforcement learning, and its agents are executed in parallel.
